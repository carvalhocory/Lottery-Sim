# Lottery-Sim
Lottery simulator built as a recruiting exercise. 

I practice algorithms a fair bit and write small programs here and there, but this is more substantial and shows my coding/project structure ability at the moment fairly well. 

Code is fairly descriptive in it self but it takes groups of ticket objects, allows purches, draws, draws for only winning tickets, and different kinds of resets. Gives feedback on every piece of relevant information I could think of.

Took about 5 hours to write, it also is written to be tested and contains tests for basic function/limits/error handling.
